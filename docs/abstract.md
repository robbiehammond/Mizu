Simulation is one of the most computationally heavy tasks a programmer can do, and most laptops and home machines are incapable of doing it seriously. Access to the High Performance Computing Cluster this semester has inspired us to simulate one of the most important resources we have - water.

Pouring water on various surfaces and materials is an incredibly complex process to simulate, and is only possible now that we have access to the cluster. In this project, we will describe and simulate a water source as well as the reaction using the High Performance Computing tool. Because different surfaces will have different shapes and sizes, each simulation will be unique. The result of the simulation can provide deep understanding about the process, which can be refactored and utilized for future use.

Our simulation will make use of modern programming practices for maximal performance with HPC systems such as lock-free multithreading, CUDA, job batching, etc. Each simulation will have multiple fully customizable parameters to modify each run - including material settings, environment gravity, atmospheric pressure, etc.
